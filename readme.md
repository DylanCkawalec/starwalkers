## Gameplay:

Players start by choosing their Arcanist and establishing a base. As they explore Al-Qasr, they'll encounter neutral Jins, enemy territories, and ancient scriptures. By securing these resources, players can expand their empire, research new spells and traps, and strengthen their deck.

The game operates in cycles, with players managing their empire in third-person, setting up defenses, and planning attacks. When engaging enemy Arcanists or neutral objectives, the game can switch to a first-person perspective, offering a more action-packed experience.

Duels between Arcanists play out in real-time, with players using their decks and abilities to outmaneuver their opponents. The outcome of these duels can reshape the map, with territories changing hands and empires rising or falling.

Throughout the game, players must balance their 'Eman' production, ensuring they have enough resources to cast spells, set traps, and summon Jins. The ultimate goal is to dominate Al-Qasr, either by defeating all enemy Arcanists or controlling the most powerful Jins and wells.

With its blend of strategy, action, and empire-building, Starwalkers offers players a unique and immersive gaming experience.
